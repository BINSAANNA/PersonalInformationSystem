<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000">Towards the end of 

the 18th century, the East India Company planned to set up a Gun Powder Factory 

of their own. They selected a place where the Dutch Ostend Company had run a Gun 

Powder Factory from 1712 to 1744. The selected land was in possession of 

Maharaja Nobkissen Bahadur since 1769. The East India Company made an exchange 

settlement with the Maharaja to acquire this land. </font> <br>

<font color="#800080">

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>&nbsp;A Deed dated 28th April, 1778 was made between the Maharaja 

and the Governor General of United Company, Warren Hastings. In exchange for Noapara and certain other villages belonging to the estate of the Maharaja, the 

Company awarded him talookdari of several villages situated in Calcutta, 

containing bazaar Sootaloottee, Subah Bazar, Charles Bazar, Baugh Bazar etc.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000"> It is known from the marble plaque on the main gate of the 

factory that the work for setting up the Gun Powder factory Ishapore, commenced 

sometime in 1787 under J. Farquhar, Agent and production started from 1st 

January 1791 and continued for more than a hundred years till 1st June 1902.</font><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> </font>From the editorial note of the Statesman dated 8 July 1901, 

it is revealed that one Captain Moore of the Indian Ordnance department was 

assigned the task of creating facilities at Ishapore for turning out 25,000 

rifles and carbines annually on the lines of an existing factory at Sparkbrook 

near Birmingham. The site of gun powder factory was selected for setting up this 

factory. On completion of the work, production started from 20th September 1904. 

The factory was renamed as Rifle Factory, Ishapore.<font color="#800000"><br>

</font>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> Parallels of this factory can be drawn with Royal Small Arm 

Factory of Enfield Lock- a suburban township, North of London, where the famous 

Enfield Rifle was born and which had been the home for the design, development, 

manufacture and testing of small arms. Ishapore was rightly christened as the 

'Enfield of India' in view of the geographical and other similarities between 

the two locations. RFI thence embarked upon a long journey in the field of small 

arms and in its march to glory, produced blend of small arms from the kookriees, 

swords, bayonets, revolvers, pistols, carbines, muskets, bazooka launcher 

rockets to 7.62 SLR Ishapore Rifles, 9mm Auto Pistols and 5.56 INSAS and made 

its indelible mark in the history of small arms production in India.</font><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the World War I &amp; II, the factory produced large 

quantities of .303 Bolt Action Rifles to meet the war requirements. In addition 

to this, repair works for Light Machine Guns like MAXIM, LEWIS, HOTCHKISS and 

VICKERS were also carried out.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> The first step towards Indianisation of Ordnance Factories 

Supervisory Cadre was initiated at RFI when the scheme for training of 

apprentices started in the year 1920. The Ordnance Technical School a pioneer in 

Technical Training in Ordnance Factories imparted Training to the young 

inductees at workmen and supervisory levels.<br>

</font>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Independence, due to shortage of work load from the 

Military Services, the factory had to diversify its production activities. The 

factory undertook design &amp; development of Civil weapons to keep the manpower 

engaged. Manufacture of 12 Bore DBBL &amp; SBBL Shot Guns started in the year 1953. 

In the year 1956, .315" Sporting Rifle was established. Even today this weapon 

has a very good demand in the Civil Market.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000"> In 1962, the factory was called upon to establish 7.62mm 

Semi-Automatic Rifle to meet the Army's emergent operational requirements. The 

task was carried out with great success and the factory was commended for the 

extra ordinary feat in the India Parliament by the then Defence Minister.' The 

design and development of 7.62mm Ishapore Rifle was completed within the 

shortest possible time and regular production started with effect from 1964-65. 

In recognition ofthis achievement of the factory, the then General Manager K.C. 

Banerjee was conferred 'PADMASHREE' by the Govt. of India.</font><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranging! Sub-Calibre Guns for 106mm RCL, 105 Tank Gun and 

84mm Rocket Launcher were successfully productionised by the factory during the 

seventies and early eighties. The factory successfully established production of 

9mm Pistol Auto in the year 1977 which continues to be in production till date.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> In the year 1994, serial production of 5.56mm INSAS Rifle was 

started. The rifle of contemporary international standard had been developed by 

the factory in partnership with ARDE. DRDO Technology Assimilation Award was 

conferred on the factory by the Prime Minister of India in 1997.</font><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 1999, RFI has developed and established 

production of a .22" Sporting Rifle of international quality for the Civil 

sector. Through in-house R&amp;D, RFI has also developed 0.22 Revolver in 2001-02 

for the civil sector, where it is attracting large demand.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> In recent times, the factory has modernized considerably with 

the induction of latest technology in production areas to maintain high quality 

standard and improved production .techniques to economize cost of output. 

CAD/CAM has been provided for product! process design. Today, RFI is an ISO-9000 

certified company. Its Chemical &amp; Metallurgical Laboratory is NABL accredited 

Now, with its 'State-of-the-Art' technology, skilled manpower and best 

manufacturing practices, it is considered as the Jewel in the Crown of the 

Ordnance Factories Organisation.<br>
